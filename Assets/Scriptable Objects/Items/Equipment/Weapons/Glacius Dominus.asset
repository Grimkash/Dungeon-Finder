  description: This legendary hammer is said to contain the power to freeze entire
    continents. It was forged by the Demon-Smith Ytharigos eons ago. However, its
    immense power proved to be too much for any mortal to wield. It was then cast
    into the depths of the ocean, never to be seen again.
